Taxes and Discounts
===================


If discounts are applied before taxes, things are kept simple: Tax
calculation can be performed on the discounted subtotal of line
items and of whole orders.

If a discount should be applied on a price with tax included, things
are a bit more complicated: Money which does not change owner should
not be included in the tax total, which means that the simple way of
calculating taxes and discounts produces too much tax in the end.


Order example with tax rate 7.60%:

Line item subtotal incl. tax: 100.00
Line item subtotal excl. tax:  92.40
Line item tax:                  7.60

Discount 20% on paid amount:   18.48
Stupid discount calculation:   20.00 (WRONG, 1.52 too much, = 7.6 * 0.2)

Applying 20% discount should yield an order total of 80.00

Backwards calculation:
Total: 80.00
Without tax: 74.35 (Tax: 5.65)

74.35 + 20 = 94.35
94.35 * 1.076 = 101.5206 (1.52 too much)

Effective discount total: 18.58736

(74.35 + 18.59) * 1.076 ~= 100


Creating discounts on totals with tax included is more profitable for
the shop owner, because the effective tax total is the shown tax total
divided by (1+current tax rate).
