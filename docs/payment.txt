Payment support
===============

Plata supports the following means of payment:

* :ref:`payment_cod`
* :ref:`payment_paypal`
* :ref:`payment_postfinance`
* :ref:`payment_ogone`


.. _payment_cod:

Cash on delivery
================

This payment module does not need any configuration. It simply creates
an order payment with the order total as amount and confirms the order.


.. _payment_paypal:

Paypal
======

The Paypal payment module needs two configuration values::

    PAYPAL = {
        'LIVE': False, # Use sandbox or live payment interface?
        'BUSINESS': 'paypal@example.com',
        }

The default IPN URL is ``payment/paypal/ipn/``; the base path is defined
by where you added  ``shop.urls``.


.. _payment_postfinance:

Postfinance
===========

The Postfinance payment module requires the following configuration values::

    POSTFINANCE = {
        'LIVE': False,
        'PSPID': 'exampleShopID',
        'SHA1_IN': '<shared secret>',
        'SHA1_OUT': '<shared secret>',
        }

This module implements payments using SHA-1 hash validation with the simpler
SHA-1 IN hashing algorithm.

The default server to server notification URL is ``payment/postfinance/ipn/``;
the base path is defined by where you added ``shop.urls``.


.. _payment_ogone:

Ogone
=====

The Ogone payment module requires the following configuration values::

    OGONE = {
        'LIVE': False,
        'PSPID': 'exampleShopID',
        'SHA1_IN': '<shared secret>',
        'SHA1_OUT': '<shared secret>',
        }

This module implements payments using SHA-1 hash validation with the simpler
SHA-1 IN hashing algorithm.

The default server to server notification URL is ``payment/ogone/ipn/``;
the base path is defined by where you added ``shop.urls``.
