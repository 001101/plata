===================
Database migrations
===================

Plata does not include database migrations for South (anymore). The reason for
that is that Django (and by extension, South) does not support the concept of
lazy foreign keys. Because you're free to choose any model as product for Plata
(configurable using ``PLATA_SHOP_PRODUCT``) we do not know beforehand, how the
database constraints for the order item product foreign key should look
beforehand. Because of that it's easier for everyone to just not include any
migrations and instead provide instructions in the release notes when a database
migration has to be performed.

The following issues on Github will shed further light upon this issue:

- `<https://github.com/matthiask/plata/issues/33>`_
- `<https://github.com/matthiask/plata/issues/27>`_
- `<https://github.com/matthiask/plata/issues/26>`_


.. note::

   Despite not bundling database migrations, using South (or another database
   migration solution) is very much recommended and officially supported. Any
   pitfalls will be documented here and in the release notes.


.. _migrations_configuration:

Configuring South for Plata
===========================

Since the migrations are project-specific, the migration files should be added
to your apps, and not to Plata itself. This can be achieved using the following
South setting::

    SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES = {
        'contact': 'yourapp.migrate.contact',
        'discount': 'yourapp.migrate.discount',
        'stock': 'yourapp.migrate.stock',  # If you're using stock tracking
        'shop': 'yourapp.migrate.shop',
        }

You'll have to add a folder ``migrate`` in your app containing only an
empty ``__init__.py`` file for these instructions to work. After that you
can use ``./manage.py convert_to_south`` on each Plata app and you're done.

.. note::

   You can use any other name for the ``migrate`` folder **except for**
   ``migrations``. By using ``migrations`` you're telling South that this
   folder contains migrations for the ``yourapp`` app, and this **will**
   confuse South.


.. _migrations_upgrading:

Upgrading instructions
======================

From v1.1 to v1.2
-----------------

Run the following commands in the SQL shell::

    ./manage.py dbshell
    DELETE FROM south_migrationhistory WHERE app_name='contact';
    DELETE FROM south_migrationhistory WHERE app_name='discount';
    DELETE FROM south_migrationhistory WHERE app_name='stock';
    DELETE FROM south_migrationhistory WHERE app_name='shop';

Add the SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES`` setting above, and run the following
commands::

    ./manage.py convert_to_south contact
    ./manage.py convert_to_south discount
    ./manage.py convert_to_south stock
    ./manage.py convert_to_south shop
