==================================
Plata 1.2 release notes (upcoming)
==================================

Welcome to Plata 1.2!


Backwards-incompatible changes
==============================

South migrations removal
------------------------

Plata does not include database migrations for South (anymore). The reason for
that is that Django (and by extension, South) does not support the concept of
lazy foreign keys. Because you're free to choose any model as product for Plata
(configurable using ``PLATA_SHOP_PRODUCT``) we do not know beforehand, how the
database constraints for the order item product foreign key should look
beforehand.

Upgrade instructions and further informations are available in
:ref:`migrations`.


Cart handling changes
---------------------

Products do not have to be unique in a cart or an order anymore. This change
allows more flexibility in product models, for example the implementation of
configurable products where an article (i.e. a copmuter) can be bought with
different combinations of upgrades.

Additionally, if a product is deleted from the inventory, the cart view
removes the order item and notifies the user. The behavior for orders in or
after the checkout process has not been changed.


Custom User model support
-------------------------

The ``plata.shop`` migrations will no longer apply if you're using a custom
user model. In this case, use the ``SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES`` settings to
specify the location of your custom migrations.

Suggestion: before creating your initial ``plata.shop`` migration, comment
out the entire ``OrderItem`` model from ``plata.shop.models`` and run
``manage.py schemamigration shop --initial`` so that you have an initial
migration which doesn't depend on your ``Product`` model. Then create
your migration for your ``Product`` model's app, which is likely dependent
upon ``plata.shop`` models such as ``TaxClass``, so you can add
``depends_on = (('shop', '0001_initial'),)`` to that migration.
Finally, reinstate the ``OrderItem`` model definition, and run
``manage.py schemamigration shop --auto``, optionally adding another
``depends_on`` definition to ensure that your ``Product`` model is created
first.

TODO: update tests to handle custom User model


Django compatibility
--------------------

Plata is developed and tested with Django 1.4 and the upcoming 1.5.


Notable features
================

* The shop view now comes with two additional methods, ``redirect`` and
  ``reverse_url`` which can be used to customize the URL reversal process which
  is especially useful with namespaced URLs.

* The Django model used for stock tracking can be changed using the new
  ``PLATA_STOCK_TRACKING_MODEL`` setting.

* The product foreign key on stock transactions now has ``on_delete=SET_NULL``
  set as well.

* If the method ``Product.handle_stock_transaction`` exists, it is called
  when saving stock transactions providing the opportunity for filling in
  additional fields.

* Tax classes no longer have reverse foreign keys to prices. That means that
  having more than one price model in a project is now fully supported.

* Whether prices should be shown with tax included or not can be decided
  per-order now.


Bugfixes
========

* The plata context processor does not crash anymore when there is no
  session.

* The shop does not crash anymore during checkout if email sending fails for
  some reason.
