==================================
Plata 1.2 release notes (upcoming)
==================================

Welcome to Plata 1.2!


Backwards-incompatible changes
==============================

South migrations removal
------------------------


Django compatibility
--------------------

Plata is developed and tested with Django 1.4 and the upcoming 1.5.


Notable features
================

* The shop view now comes with two additional methods, ``redirect`` and
  ``reverse_url`` which can be used to customize the URL reversal process which
  is especially useful with namespaced URLs.

* The Django model used for stock tracking can be changed using the new
  ``PLATA_STOCK_TRACKING_MODEL`` setting.

* The product foreign key on stock transactions now has ``on_delete=SET_NULL``
  set as well.

* If the method ``Product.handle_stock_transaction`` exists, it is called
  when saving stock transactions providing the opportunity for filling in
  additional fields.

* Tax classes no longer have reverse foreign keys to prices. That means that
  having more than one price model in a project is now fully supported.


Bugfixes
========

* The plata context processor does not crash anymore when there is no
  session.

* The shop does not crash anymore during checkout if email sending fails for
  some reason.
