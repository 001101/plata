Plata 1.2 release notes
=======================

Welcome to Plata 1.2!


Custom User model support
=========================

The ``plata.shop`` migrations will no longer apply if you're using a custom
user model. In this case, use the ``SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES`` settings to
specify the location of your custom migrations.

Suggestion: before creating your initial ``plata.shop`` migration, comment
out the entire ``OrderItem`` model from ``plata.shop.models`` and run
``manage.py schemamigration shop --initial`` so that you have an initial
migration which doesn't depend on your ``Product`` model. Then create
your migration for your ``Product`` model's app, which is likely dependent
upon ``plata.shop`` models such as ``TaxClass``, so you can add
``depends_on = (('shop', '0001_initial'),)`` to that migration.
Finally, reinstate the ``OrderItem`` model definition, and run
``manage.py schemamigration shop --auto``, optionally adding another
``depends_on`` definition to ensure that your ``Product`` model is created
first.
