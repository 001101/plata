==================================
Plata 1.1 release notes (upcoming)
==================================


Backwards-incompatible changes
==============================

Order status addition
---------------------

The order status "confirmed" was confusingly named; what it really meant
all the time is that the order can be considered paid. Whether an order is
confirmed or not depends on the shop owner's definitions.

Because of this the existing ``Order.CONFIRMED`` status has been renamed
to ``Order.PAID``, ``Order.CONFIRMED`` has been added as a new order status
coming after ``Order.PAID``. Plata only knows about ``Order.PAID`` and never
changes an order to ``COMPLETED`` itself.

To update your installations to Plata v1.1, you'll have to make the following
changes:

* Instead of ``order.is_completed()`` you might want to test for
  ``order.is_paid()`` now.

* The shop signal ``order_completed`` has been renamed to ``order_paid``. Signal
  handlers receive the same arguments as before.

* The email template used in the ``SendInvoiceHandler`` has been renamed to
  ``order_paid.txt``.

* If you wrote your own payment modules, the method you'll want to call at the
  end is now named ``order_paid``, not ``order_completed`` anymore. Apart from
  the renaming the signature of the function has not changed.


Notable features
================

* Ogone is now a supported payment service provider (PSP).
