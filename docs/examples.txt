Examples
========

Plata's repository contains a few example projects, which are used both
to demonstrate specific features and allow experimentation.

The purpose of each example project will be briefly described in the
following.


``simple`` example
==================

This example strives to be the simplest shop implementation with Plata
while still following best practice.


``custom`` example
==================

The custom example demonstrates how the bundled contact model might be
replaced with a custom model -- in this case, the replacement model only
has one address record, not two addresses, one for shipping and one for
billing.


``staggered`` example
=====================

This example demonstrates how a staggered (or "tiered") price scheme
might be implemented outside of Plata's core.


``oneprice`` example
====================

This example demonstrates how a product model might be made even simpler:
By extending ``ProductBase`` and ``PriceBase`` at the same time, all
product related information is kept in one Django model. This (obviously)
means that each product can only have one price.
