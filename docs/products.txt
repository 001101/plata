Products
========


This document is meant as a guide to using and extending the built-in
product model.

The product model itself only contains the bare minimum needed to get
up and running. A name, a description, a stock keeping unit and a few
flags, that's it.


Product prices
==============

Plata comes with a flexible product price model allowing you to store
several prices for a product using different time periods, currencies,
tax classes etc.

If it is already known that a product will change its price in a few
days or weeks, you don't have to stay up all night just to make this
change - just add a new product price and set the validity period so
that the price isn't activated until the day you specify.


Product variations
==================

All products have at least one ``ProductVariation``. While a product
could be "T-Shirt XY", product variations exist for each available
combination of color and size.

Products without option groups still have exactly one product
variation. The variation is used to track items in stock and is put
in carts.


Categories
==========

Categories serve two purposes: They are used to group products in
related groups, internal categories are used to logically group
products f.e. for the discount module or for whatever idea the shop
managers have.


Extending the product model
===========================

Extending is easily doable through subclassing. Plata does not offer
any helpers for creating polymorphic models and resolving subclasses;
other applications such as django_polymorphic_ should be used for this
purpose.

Plata comes with a sample producer extension which adds a producer model
and a foreign key to every product, and with a sample FeinCMS_-enabled
product subclass which allows the administrator to use FeinCMS_ content
types to assemble the product description instead of a boring text field
or a single rich text area.
