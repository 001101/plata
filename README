===========================================
Pasta - the lean and mean Django-based Shop
===========================================

Instead of fighting against a big and all-knowing shop system, which
never does the right thing although it "only requires pushing a few
configuration buttons here and there", Pasta only provides simple
order and payment models. Building a shop on top of Django and Pasta
requires programming skills -- but that's what we are here for, no?
